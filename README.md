## Hello World! This is my portfolio project!

Everyone should have a resume / short bio / goals and other stuff that stands you out from the crowd. And I'm not an
exemption of that rule :)

This project was created not only to sum up a basic info about me as a developer but rather show how I used to work with
certain range of technologies and what kind of code quality I can produce. Keep in mind, this a small project so that I cannot
enclose my fullest potential here (that would be an over-engineering, don't you think?).

In addition, here I will add my small apps I made for myself and anybody who will love to use some small though handy tools like [credit-estimator](https://github.com/RShalman/credit-estimator).

## Tech stack 

- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- SCSS

Imported projects implemented as micro-frontends via packages.

## To play around with this project

To run the project locally execute the following commands (after downloading the repo):
```
npm i

npm run dev
or
make dev
```

**NOTE!** 

Micro-frontend packages like `credit-estimator` are installed via `SSH` so you won't be able to install them directly.
In order to fix this change to `https` way of installing those packages.

### Have fun & happy coding!
